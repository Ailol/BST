# BST


## Not a perfect product!

The binary tree is simply a steppingstone in understanding the AVL operations on a basic level.
However, still uploading it up if anyone finds it helpful. But beware that there are propably bugs
in the code and is not testet properly. 


## What it is good for
 
However it is a great tool in graphically displaying how a BST looks after instertion of nodes. 
plot.c is responsiple for generating the .dot files and use graphviz(sudo apt-get install graphviz) to view files.


# How to run
 - $Make compiles and generates a .dot file
